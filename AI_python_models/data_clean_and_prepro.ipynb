      "Leffingwell said Capital Metro’s trains are \"full\" during rush hour and \"packed\" for events such as SXSW and the F1 race. Capital Metro considers a train full if all 108 seats are occupied, but would a typical commuter agree? After the seats are full, 92 additional passengers can ride standing up (and pay the same fares to do so). If you’re a rider who needs to get to work, there’s a big difference between a train you can board and a train that’s so packed you have to wait for the next one. At the peak of the special events Leffingwell named in 2012, about 48 more people could have ridden the average SXSW Saturday train and another 68 could have boarded an average F1 train. It’s a tighter squeeze at rush hour: With average ridership at 155, the trains tend to have all seats full and so many standing riders that only about 45 more can squish aboard. Seats might all be occupied, but there’s almost always still room on the trains for more passengers. We rate the mayor’s  as .\n",

McCain has even acknowledged that fact himself, saying in a June 23 town hall meeting in Fresno, Ca., \"Even though it may take some years, the fact that we are exploiting those reserves would have psychological impact that I think is beneficial.\" * McCain has \"voted with Bush 95 percent of the time.\" We've also dealt with this  previously and concluded that it accurately reflects a 2007 \"presidential support\" score from Congressional Quarterly.\n",

      "North Carolina Republican Rep. Ted Budd defended his vote for the American Health Care Act, saying it will \"significantly reduce insurance premiums in\" North Carolina. In the short-term, insurance premiums on North Carolina’s individual market would actually increase. It’s not a small increase, either, but is rather expected to be the second-largest in the nation. Budd does have a point that premiums are expected to decrease in cost nationally a decade from now. People can quibble over whether an expected 10 percent decline is \"significant,\" but it is a decline. However, that’s a national estimate. There’s no solid analysis yet into how North Carolina specifically might fare, a point against Budd. It's also just an average. Some people will see lower premiums, while others will see higher premiums – for many of them, high enough that experts believe they'll drop insurance entirely. And finally, even people with lower premiums might still pay more in the end, since their deductibles could be higher under the AHCA.
